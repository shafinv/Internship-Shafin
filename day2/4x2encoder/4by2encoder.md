# Assignment: 4-to-2 Encoder

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Design and verify a 4-to-2 Encoder using behavioral modeling in Verilog. The circuit must compress a 4-bit one-hot input vector into a 2-bit binary output.

## 🧠 Logic & Theoretical Derivation
A standard 4-to-2 encoder takes 4 input lines ($D_0, D_1, D_2, D_3$) and generates 2 output lines ($Y_0, Y_1$). In a strict one-hot encoder setup, only one input is actively driven high at any given time.

The Boolean expressions for the outputs are derived as:
$$Y_1 = D_2 + D_3$$
$$Y_0 = D_1 + D_3$$

## 💻 Implementation Details
* `encoder4to2.v`: Implements the encoder logic using a behavioral always block. A case statement evaluates the 4-bit input vector and maps it to the corresponding 2-bit encoded output, with a default state to prevent inferred latches during synthesis.
* `encoder4to2_tb.v`: The testbench utilizes a for loop to programmatically generate one-hot input stimuli. It shifts the active bit leftward ($1, 2, 4, 8$) and utilizes $monitor to log the output responses to the console.

## 📊 Simulation Results
* Status: Passed Behavioral Simulation.
